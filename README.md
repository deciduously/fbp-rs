# fbp-rs

WIP.  Currently it can take a Factorio blueprint string like the one found at [resource/balancer.txt](http://github.com/deciduously/fbp-rs/blob/master/resource/balancer.txt) and turn it into a Rust datastructure.  For testing purposes, the json produced from decoding that string can be found at [resource/balancer.json](https://github.com/deciduously/fbp-rs/blob/master/resource/balancer.json), but it's only used to test against the app's version.

Stay tuned for hopefully something useful here.
